*    and conversions to other media types.
* 
*    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
*    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
*    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
*    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
* 
*    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
*    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
*    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
*    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
*    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
*    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
*    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
* 
*    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
*    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

*    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
* 
*    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
*    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
*    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
* 
* 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
*    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
*    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
*    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
*    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
*    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
* 
* 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
*    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
*    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
*    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
*    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
*    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
*    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
*    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
*    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
*    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
*    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
*    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
*    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
*    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
*    as of the date such litigation is filed.
* 
* 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
*    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
*    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
*    meet the following conditions:
* 
*    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
*        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
* 
*    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
*        stating that You changed the files; and
* 
*    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
*        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
*        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
*        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
*        the Derivative Works; and
* 
*    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
*        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
*        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
*        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
*        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
*        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
*        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
*        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
*        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
*        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
*        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
*        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
*        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
*        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
*        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
*        as modifying the License.
* 
*    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
*    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
*    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
*    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
*    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
*    the conditions stated in this License.
* 
* 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
*    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
*    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
*    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
*    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
*    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
*    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
* 
* 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
*    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
*    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
*    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
* 
* 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
*    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
*    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
*    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
*    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
*    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
*    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
*    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
*    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
* 
* 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
*    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
*    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
*    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
*    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
*    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
*    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
*    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
*    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
*    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
*    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
* 
* 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
*    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
*    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
*    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
*    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
*    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
*    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
*    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
*    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
*    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
* 
* END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
* 
* --- Exceptions to the Apache 2.0 License ----
* 
* As an exception, if, as a result of your compiling your source code, portions
* of this Software are embedded into an Object form of such source code, you
* may redistribute such embedded portions in such Object form without complying
* with the conditions of Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(d) of the License.
* 
* In addition, if you combine or link compiled forms of this Software with
* software that is licensed under the GPLv2 ("Combined Software") and if a
* court of competent jurisdiction determines that the patent provision (Section
* 3), the indemnity provision (Section 9) or other Section of the License
* conflicts with the conditions of the GPLv2, you may retroactively and
* prospectively choose to deem waived or otherwise exclude such Section(s) of
* the License, but only in their entirety and only with respect to the Combined
* Software.
